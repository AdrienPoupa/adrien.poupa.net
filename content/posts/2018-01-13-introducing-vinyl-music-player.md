We all listen to music on our smartphones. Since I’m old-fashioned, I still have a local library and no Spotify subscription. I’ve been using the [Phonograph](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kabouzeid.gramophone) music player for a few years but after having see its development stopped for a few months, its creator decided to put some of its best features behind a paywall. For instance, it was not longer possible to browse files to play a music.

![](https://cdn.poupa.net/uploads/2018/01/unnamed5.png)The creation of a Pro version has raised an uproar on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/6x735i/phonograph_music_player_introduces_pro_version/), which I consider justified since Phonograph being an open source project, a large amount of work is done by voluntary contributors who would not get any donations. Moreover, the owner clearly [stated](https://plus.google.com/+KarimAbouZeid23697/posts/PFbgdKzWNAh) that his sole motivation was money.

Therefore, since the GPLv3 licence allows me to do so, I’ve forked it to [Vinyl Music Player](https://github.com/AdrienPoupa/VinylMusicPlayer). It removes all the paywalls and enables pro features such as folder view, sleep timer and a dark theme.

It is now available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.poupa.vinylmusicplayer) and on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.poupa.vinylmusicplayer) soon.
